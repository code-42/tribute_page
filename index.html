    A true story:  about 25 years ago as I was walking across the Quad at Northeastern University, some guy over by Dodge Hall was selling computers.  He was set up outside at a tall table with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=next+computer+images&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiLufXlys_UAhVO9mMKHYZhAUMQsAQILw&biw=1257&bih=690" target="_blank">his computer</a> on display and had music blasting to attract attention.  So I stopped by and talked with him for a few minutes.  It was an impressive computer, all sleek looking and bigger than the Macintosh of the time.  But it was way out of my price range - like six times the price of my car!  Considering the over-abundance  of credit card applications floating around campus, it's possible that some students got buried in debt that day.  I had to go to class and so he gave me a sticker and I said goodbye.  I stuck that sticker to my file cabinet, and remarkably, I still have it.  I can't say for sure, but that man may have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target="_blank">Steve Jobs</a>, or maybe not, just saying.  And that is the day I met the man who gave me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" target="_blank">

<p>So what can I do to pay homage to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target="_blank">a man</a> who changed the world?  Well, as a <a href="http://intracitygeeks.org/careerdevs/" target="_blank">programming student</a>, I guess my daily git commits and fcc challenges are a good start.  And this assignment too.</p><p>
 But I'm looking for something that would really impress him, something Appley, something genius, something that I understand innately.  And that is coming... all in due time...</p>
